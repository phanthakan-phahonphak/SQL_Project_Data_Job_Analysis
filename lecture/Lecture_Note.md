<h2><b>Create the Repository</b></h2>
<h3>What is a repository</h3>

A repository is like a personal library for your project where you can keep, manage, and record<br>
every change to your documents and file. It acts as a safe space to store your work, allowing<br>
you to revisit older versions and share your progress with others.
